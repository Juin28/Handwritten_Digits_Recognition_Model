# Handwritten Digits Recognition Model using CNN

## Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the task of handwritten digits recognition. The model is built using the Keras library and utilizes the ReLU activation function. The project also includes data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

## Features
- Uses Keras library to build the CNN model
- Employs ReLU as the activation function
- Achieves an accuracy of 98.8%
- Utilizes the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset
- Includes an image for prediction and a heatmap visualization

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/Juin28/Handwritten_Digits_Recognition_Model.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script:
```
python handwritten_digits_recognition_model.py
```

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 98.8% on the MNIST dataset.

## Visualization
